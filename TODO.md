# TODO List

## Basic Implementation

- [ ] Fix their implementation in PyTorch
- [ ] Make sure stuff can train on their setup first

## Optimization

- [ ] Use different dataset and see if it works better
- [ ] Consult latest papers on DDPG optimization

## Customization

- [ ] Implement custom features (i.e. financial ratios)
- [ ] Implement backtesting
